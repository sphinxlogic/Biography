My father who did work on my credit, VHCC, UVa-Wise but has been a negitive reiforcement so was my step mom. Maybe it's Virginia that is just a negitive reiforcement.

<p>I seem to be the Actress's Anne Hathawy's muse accoding to my manager at the local csb. In 1998 I had my Nissian Stanza worked on and took my then girlfreind Kara to my uncle Glenn's flower shop which reminds me of Hathaway's 'Valentines day'. on I worked for Macromedia in San Fransisco from 1999-2006 and made alot of film and artist enhanced cd's in cluding the Princess diaries. Where I licenced Macromedia Patents and Macromedia Flash Source Code still in NDA. Made Macromedia Director Xtra's in C++ also, I was diagnosed with scizoaffective in 2001. I made a IRS 1065 Partner intangable return for $1 million. And the Dr. had the ballgasity to ask if I was worth that much and fell for the dr's game theroy 'agree to disagree' when I didn't give him my college grades in 2001 if getting straight A's in college in computer science isn't processing information correctly I don't know what is. I was diagnosed without given a formal MRI which I finally recieved in 2018. Which was normal. It was a MRI with contrast which looks for schizophenia. I was hospitalized agian in 2006 after recieving my Microsoft tender offer from the capital markets. In 2016 the NIH started defunding the DSM V. The latter reminds of Hathaway's 'Rachel Getting Married' in 2008.</p>

Hathaway's 'Bride Wars' reminds me of the likeness of my two college roommates playing xbox. And her 'Passengers' reminds me of the time when I was flirting with hospital staff. Her 'Mother's Instict' reminds me onf my mom and the Shepard's at St. Annes. Pluto and Venus are soulmates if you believe in that. My last hospitalization was in 2021 as a Roayl Society of the arts fellow. The officer broke the law by takeing me when I cliamed domesitc security which is a NSA policy violation.
